# The-Lion-King-Sentiment-Analysis
## Problem Description:

Online reviews are important because they have become a reference point for buyers across the globe and because so many people trust them when making purchase decisions.

Reviews are also important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Having positive reviews is also another way through which you can improve a website’s Search Engine visibility. The more that people talk about a brand online, the greater its visibility to Search Engines, such as Google, Yahoo and Bing.

For the production house, analysing negative reviews can be useful for damage control.
